      "Q: What is the prognosis of our client?\n",
      "A: : The prognosis of our client is that he continues to have good and bad days due to flare ups of pain. Such unexpected halting pain robs him of the enjoyment of life he had prior to the accident of July 30, 2021. Caring for his daily activities, many times can only be accomplished under duress. The once normal and commonplace activities before the accident are now attempted with concerns of exacerbating his injuries. The determination of Mr. Rolax’s functions in caring for his daily activities is the intensity and frequency of the painful flare ups. Having to go through life with constant awareness that anything he may do, would inflame this injury, deprives him of the pleasure of life he once enjoyed.\n",
      "Q: What are the mental, emotions, and other non-physical damage Our Client's suffer?\n",
      "A: : Our Client, Ronald Rolax, is entitled to recover damages for all personal injuries caused by this accident, including damages for emotional distress and economic damages. He is entitled to recover the reasonable value of time, earnings, or salaries lost and the present value of reasonable future losses. Loss of earning capacity is a permanent diminution of ability to earn a living owing to disability as opposed to the temporary inability to continue in a prior occupation. Ronald Rolax may also recover for pain and suffering which compensates for the physical and mental discomfort caused by the injury. Negligently inflicted mental distress is compensable, as is distress about the fear of the future consequences of an injury. Loss of ability to enjoy life is a proper element of damages, and if there are special artistic or athletic skills, separate or added distress compensation is appropriate.\n",
