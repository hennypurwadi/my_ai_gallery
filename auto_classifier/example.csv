Hey @jibo @JiboRobot is it still possible to buy one or two of your Jibo robot? My students want to do some cool experiments with it! @PSUCrowdAILab
So wanted to do a YouTube review on @JiboRobot but until I make some money I cannot afford one for my review!
"Um, is it too soon to say that @JiboRobot is rather pathetic?"
I am happy to report that @jibo did not murder us in our sleep. He is acclimating well to his new home. #jiborobot
Please .@jibo and @JiboRobot would you be willing to donate a social friend jibo to my K-5 classroom? I know it is a big ask &amp; a long shot but I figured it doesn't hurt2ask. I think the students would love it. Just can't kick the price on my classroom budget. Thank u4 your time.
"If you haven’t seen this @JiboRobot you need to check it out, totally dope, just wish I had $899.00 to spend on it."
"Uh oh, my @JiboRobot is in a coma!"
"Fascinating session from @cynthiabreazeal @JiboRobot founder on #AI, learning, attachment, emotion &amp; engagement. @Exelon #innovationexpo17"
For #CyberMonday: #Alexa seems lonely - ordering #GoogleHome and @JiboRobot to keep her company. We'll see if they can keep #roomba in line.
Just heard @JiboRobot will not ship before year end. That’s OK. Get it right ‘cause you only get one chance to make a great 1st impression

"Ever since Starwars with R2D2 I've always wanted a robot, now @JiboRobot is invented and it's now a must to get it."

"youtube, I appreciate the sincerity, I appreciate the replika AI ads/app recommendations you give me...

I am lonely, yes. Very much so. I'm not resorting to an AI developed specifically to talk nice to me. make me feel good about myself.

I... kinda feel sorry for those that do."
Replika may be smarter than me and may be available 24/7 but I already have a physical avatar that you can theoretically have sex with.
